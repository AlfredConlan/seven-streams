## September 21-27, 2018
## Sedona, AZ

Of all the teachings that were presented to me in my time at Naropa University, Marshall Rosenberg’s explanation of a practical way we can alter our communication to create a more peaceful and joyful world that is more connected to the heart and spirit was one of my favorites.

During this retreat, we will learn about the four major aspects of living an NVC-inspired lifestyle.

- Learning the difference between making observations and judgements and practicing a more observational way of being in the world.
- Learning to identify and courageously express our feelings, while we learn how to educationally guess at what someone else might be feeling and to translate someone’s actions into the feeling that is at the core of what they are doing.
- Developing a deeper understand of the needs that are at the heart of every human being.
- Cultivating the courage to ask for what you need, without punishing someone for saying “no” to your request.

It will be a week of learning, growing and practicing with our use of Observations, Feelings, Needs and Requests.

You are welcome to attend this event in person. However, please keep in mind that this will be a camping setting and you will be required to provide all of your own meals, housing (RV, van, car or tent) and transportation to and from the event. The event will take place in the area between Cottonwood and Sedona, AZ. If you would like to participate in-person in this retreat, please send an email expressing your interest to 7streamsrc@gmail.com and I will relay the exact GPS coordinates of the gathering.

We will also be broadcasting the main teaching moments of the retreat to supporters on “The Mindful Nomad” YouTube channel. If you plan to participate in the event remotely, please send an email to let us know that you are going to be part of the group, even though you are far away. We will make every effort to make you feel included in what we are doing in the real world.

Participation in all retreats, whether in-person or remotely, is covered under your $12/year membership fee with SSRC
