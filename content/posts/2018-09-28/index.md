## October 26 - November 1
## TBD

We combine yoga, meditation, mindfulness practices and golf instruction in this “golf retreat”. Learn and improve your golf game and develop a deeper connection to who you really are.


You can choose to camp with “The Mindful Nomad” in an RV, van, car or tent for no charge. There are also sure to be hotels in the vicinity.. The daily practices of yoga/stretching, meditation and mindfulness practices will take place at “Mindful Camp”. 

Driving range and green fees will be each individual’s responsibility. As a group, we will discuss the local options and the desired budget for our rounds of golf/eating out.
