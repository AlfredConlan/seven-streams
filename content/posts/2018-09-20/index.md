## October 12-18, 2018
## Pahrump, NV

Join us for a week of all things pertaining to living life out on the road. Whether you’re a vandweller, full-time RVer or you call your car your home, let’s get together and discuss strategies for living your best nomadic lifestyle.

Subjects for discussion

- Sharing our favorite free campsites (only available if you attend in person)
- Touring people’s setups and discussing ways to optimize space that fits your lifestyle
- Sharing our favorite websites for life on the road
- Working on the road
- Internet
- Solar
- Getting mail
- Establishing residency
- etc.

As a supporter, you are welcome to join me in person for this event if you would like. It is unlikely that Seven Streams Retreat Center will be able to provide any housing for this event, but you are more than welcome to bring your car, van or RV and camp nearby to participate in the daily routine of life at SSRC.

Location: Near Pahrump, NV (Contact SSRC for the exact coordinates)

We will also do live-streams of the educational aspects of the event on “The Mindful Nomad” YouTube channel. Please let us know if you plan to be involved in the retreat from a distance, and we will do all we can to make you feel part of what is happening in the real world.

Participation in all retreats, whether in-person or remotely, is covered under your $12/year membership fee with SSRC

To participate remotely or in-person, please express your interest by sending an email to 7streamsrc@gmail.com
