## September 7-13, 2018
## Lama, NM

Come for a day, the weekend, just attend the 9am teaching and practice sessions or participate in the entire week-long event.

We start the annual retreat cycle at Seven Streams Retreat Center with the wonderful teachings of the Vietnamese monk who Martin Luther King, Jr. nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in promoting peace in the midst of the Vietnam War.

We will practice sitting meditation, mindful walking, mindful eating and all kinds of other practices that cultivate a sense of peace and joy in our lives.

If you would like to attend the full week-long retreat, you're welcome to bring your RV, van, car or tent, as we will be camping in the area around Lama, NM. That being said, whether you plan on staying overnight at the event or not, please contact me at 7streamsrc@gmail.com for the GPS coordinates of the retreat location.

If you will not be able to attend the event, we will live-stream the major teachings of the week and some of the daily practices on “The Mindful Nomad” YouTube channel, as well as on the Seven Streams Retreat Center Facebook page and on the @CenterSeven Twitter account. If you are interested in participating remotely, please email me at 7streamsrc@gmail.com so I can be sure to keep you updated on the details of the week.

Participation in all retreats, whether in-person or remotely, is covered under your $12/year membership fee with SSRC. You can bring $12 in cash to the event or you can submit payment through PayPal at mfrancisdwyer@gmail.com
